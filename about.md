## About Gillybytes
Launched in January 2020 to track my journey and contributions to the open source software community and to serve as a resource for other beginners of OSS.

### The Author
Hello! I'm Gillian.  
I began my career in public accounting after graduating from Fordham University with a BS/MS in Accounting and Taxation. While working in financial services, I realized the growing demand for innovation through technological solutions. I left my compliance role to move toward a career in software development. I am pursuing my second bachelors in Computer Science at Hunter College and will graduate in May 2020.

### More Information
As a believer in learning by doing, I interned at Bank of America as a Global Tech Analyst in the summer of 2019 and will be joining the bank fulltime in July 2020.
