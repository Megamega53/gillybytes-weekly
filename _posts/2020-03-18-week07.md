### Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 3

Last Week's Tasks:
- [x] Introduce self in the new members stream of the Zulip community
- [x] Read the Zulip [Git Guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html)
- [x] Decide how to make first contribution
- [x] Pick an issue to work on and start using the development environment

The team decided how we would make our first contribution. We browsed through the beginner-friendly issues and stumbled upon [this bug](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/3938). All team members are now in the Zulip organization I created last week. In addition to using the application as a communication channel, we hope to learn more about Zulip through our usage and to provide feedback to the Zulip community.

By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [ ] Resolve teammate's issue with installing the development environment
- [ ] Ensure teammates have read the documentation and signed the CLA
- [ ] Create a game plan/divvy up the work regarding the issue we picked
