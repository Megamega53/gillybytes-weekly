### Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 3

Last Week's Tasks:
- [x] Introduce self in the new members stream of the Zulip community
- [x] Read the Zulip [Git Guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html)
- [x] Decide how to make first contribution
- [x] Pick an issue to work on and start using the development environment

The team decided how we would make our first contribution. We browsed through the beginner-friendly issues and stumbled upon [this bug](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/3938). All team members are now in the Zulip organization I created last week. In addition to using the application as a communication channel, we hope to learn more about Zulip through our usage and to provide feedback to the Zulip community.

By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [ ] Resolve teammate's issue with installing the development environment
- [ ] Ensure teammates have read the documentation and signed the CLA
- [ ] Create a game plan/divvy up the work regarding the issue we picked


#### Wikipedia 
To explore Wikipedia, I started with the [main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I discovered that there are over 6 million articles in English on Wikipedia! I found it incredibly difficult to find content that I would like to contribute to. Although the main page is well organized, there is a plethora of information presented. I browsed through the different portals and ended up in a [Wikiproject for music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music). I don't consider myself an expert, but I am passionate about music and hope to contribute some of my knowledge in this area.
