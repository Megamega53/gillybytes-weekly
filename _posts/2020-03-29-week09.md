## Contributing to a FOSS Project: Back to Step 4

Last Week's Tasks:
- [x] Find a few issues and rank them
- [ ] Ask for clarification regarding the issue we end up choosing
- [ ] Start coding/contributing

Our team has run into problems trying to find an issue to make a contribution. Although there are several open issues, the Zulip community is very active. Issues are posted frequently, but claimed within days. Some issues are even claimed by several developers. It seems like a competition. Despite this difficulty, our team was finally able to claim an [issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12769). We think this is a good first issue to work on as new contributors. We have also learned that we must work quickly. After 14 days, the Zulip bot unassigns you from the issue. Because this issue does not seem difficult, we plan to have a working solution within the week.

By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [ ] Start coding/contributing
- [ ] Issue first pull request
