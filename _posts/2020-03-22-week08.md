## Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 4

Last Week's Tasks:
By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [x] Resolve teammate's issue with installing the development environment
- [x] Ensure teammates have read the documentation and signed the CLA
- [ ] Create a game plan/divvy up the work regarding the issue we picked

Now that our team has been using Zulip to communicate, we are more familiar with the application. There has been some confusion over what exactly the issue is that we are working on. After discussing with the team and reading over the commments in the issue thread, we drafted up a post to ask clarifying questions. I posted a topic regarding our issue in the Zulip community chat and hope to receive a response from a core contributor soon. 

By next week, I hope to achieve the following:
- [ ] Create a plan based on the response we receive
- [ ] Start coding for our first issue
