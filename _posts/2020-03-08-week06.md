## Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 1

### Project Selection: Zulip
Our team chose [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/). Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines the immediacy of real-time chat with an email threading model. We chose Zulip because it is primarily written in Python, which is a language we are all familiar with, and for its welcoming community. This week I focused on getting acquainted with the project and its community. I navigated around the repository and spent a significant amount of the time reading relevant documentation and setting up the development environment. My activites for the week are chronicled below:

| Date       | Description |
|---|:---|
|  03/05   |  * Reviewed the class project evaluations <br>  * Narrowed down selection between Zulip and Gatsby <br>  * Team ultimately selected [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) <br>  * Explored the Zulip repository: perused the README and LICENSE files <br>  * Bookmarked the [documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to read for later <br>  * Forked the repository into the class organization  |
|  03/06   |  * Explored the user-facing website of Zulip and downloaded the app for Mac OS <br>  * Created Zulip account <br>  * Navigated through the [documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  |
|  03/07   |  * Read the [guide for new contributors](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) <br>  * Explored the [chat.zulip.org community](https://chat.zulip.org/) <br>  * Read the [community norms](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html) and the [Code of Conduct](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html)|
|  03/08   |  * Created Zulip organization to use as communication channel for team <br>  *  Set up the development environment <br>  * Browsed open issues, specifically *good first issues* <br>  * Read and signed the CLA  |

To install the development environment, I installed the recommended Vagrant setup. This installation process took about 30 minutes to an hour. I am considering issues that are [beginner-friendly](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), specifically any of those that are not in progress and are tagged "help wanted". There seem to be a handful of these issues to choose from. I would like to work on either [this one](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12281) or [this one](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12249). 

By next week, I hope to achieve the following tasks:
- [ ] Introduce self in the new members stream of the Zulip community
- [ ] Read the Zulip [Git Guide](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/index.html)
- [ ] Decide how to make first contribution
- [ ] Pick an issue to work on and start using the development environment

## Other OSS Contributions
Other than beginning to make contributions to Zulip, I have continued to make edits on OpenStreetMap. Outside of class, I have continued to explore other open source software. Recently, I came across Bootstrap, which is an open source front-end development toolkit. I plan to use this library to quickly build a responsive website for my team's capstone project. Lastly, I have been actively promoting the Open Source Club at Hunter College. This Wednesday from 4 to 6:30pm in TH Room 209, we are hosting a LaTeX and Markdown with Pandoc workshop.
